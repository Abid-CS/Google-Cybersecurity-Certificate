# ðŸ§  What I Learned (Summary)

- In this first module, I got a solid overview of what cybersecurity actually is and why it matters so much today. It covered the basics like how cybersecurity is all about protecting information, devices, and systems from digital attacks.
- I learned about some of the different job responsibilities of a security analyst. Protecting computer and network systems requires an analyst to monitor an organisation's internal network. If a threat is detected, the analyst is generally the first to respond. Analysts also often take part in exercises to search for weaknesses in an organisation's own systems.
- Most of us already have skills that will be useful in the cybersecurity sector, such as communication and problem-solving. This is called a transferable skill, which is a skill from other areas of study or practice that can apply to different careers. There are also other skills that are more specific to the job, such as programming and knowing how to use SIEM tools. These are technical skills, which typically require knowledge of specific tools, procedures, and policies.
- The module also covered some of the different roles available in cybersecurity and went over how they differ from one another. For example, the difference between a cybersecurity analyst and a cybersecurity engineer is that the analyst is more focused on operations, while the engineer does more project-focused work and builds detections.
- All in all, this module laid a strong foundation and showed me how cybersecurity is more than just techâ€”it's about protecting people and businesses in a world that's becoming more digital by the day.
